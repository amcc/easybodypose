# üöÄ ML5JS easyBodyPose

[Play with easyBodyPose here](https://lab.amcc.io/easybodypose)
easyBodyPose allows you to easily use [ML5JS bodyPose](https://docs.ml5js.org/#/reference/bodypose) without worrying about loops and if statements. You can access all the body parts of a person
by typing `person.nose.x` for example to get the x position of your nose.

To avoid errors if there are no poses detected a `person` variable has been created with pre-filled objects for each body part and the keypoints. If you want to see how this is done open the `easyBodyPose.js` file.

How to use this sketch:
use the `person` variable, add a body part and access its position

<pre>
circle(person.nose.x, person.nose.y, 10)
</pre>

## Documentation

List of possible body parts in the person object:

Each body part has a `x`, `y` and `confidence` value. Confience is a score between `0` and `1`

<pre>
left_ankle
left_ear
left_elbow
left_eye
left_hip
left_knee
left_shoulder
left_wrist
nose
right_ankle
right_ear
right_elbow
right_eye
right_hip
right_knee
right_shoulder
right_wrist
</pre>

The person object also has these objects:

<pre>
box
confidence
</pre>

Box has `height`, `width`, `xMax`, `xMin`, `yMax` and `yMin`
Confience is a score between `0` and `1`

Other objects:

<pre>
keypoints
</pre>

Keypoints is an array of all the above body parts with the same values. This array is useful if you want to loop over all parts.

## Access the original bodyPose `poses` object

To access all poses as you would normally in BodyPose use the `poses` object. This is an array of all detected poses (people), each pose contains all the above variables and objects.

## üöÄ Why did you make this and how does it work?

EasyBodyPose was made because playing with body detection is fun, its a lovely way to see how easily we can connect to code and be creative with it. But using body detection is hard, to get it working and understand what is happening there is a high bar to just getting started.

Using BodyPose or any machine learning detection code requires knowledge of arrays, objects, conditionals and loops. Without understanding these it is hard to get started and it is very easy to run into errors from undetected poses.

What if we could access the nose, just like we access the mouse position. In p5js a lot of the complexity of many interactions is abstacted away, for instance mouseX gives us the mouse x position without setting up listeners, or worrying about why it works. EasyBodyPose aims to do just that.

_‚ùì Why do we access the variables as objects?_

We could have noseX, noseY rather than person.nose.x, person.nose.y - would that be better? Let me know! So far we have avoided this to prevent the easyBodyPose.js file becoming too bloated and making this harder to fork and alter. But it might be nice! Then the body would work just like the mouse.

_‚ùì Why do we only track one person?_

Only allowing one person means we can really simplify the code - but you still have access to the poses variable allowing the usage of multi-person tracking completely possible. When you're getting started with this kind of code do you really care about doing that - and once you understand about loops and conditionals then perhaps use the original [ML5js code](https://docs.ml5js.org/#/reference/bodypose)!

_‚ùì Why is the canvas in the centre of the screen?_

We wanted to add a tiny bit of styling - it looks horrible when the canvas is stuck in the top corner, so a tiny bit of CSS has been added - check out the `style.css` file where there's a comment about this.

Big improvements could be made, such as scaling the camera, detecting if its landscape or portrait and changing it accordingly, using the front or back camera (this can be done by changing the camera from `user` to `environment`).

But this over complicates things for now - if you interested discuss in the [Discussions](https://github.com/amcc/easybodypose/discussions) area!
